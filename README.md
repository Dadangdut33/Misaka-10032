## Getting Started
If you want to clone it and modify it yourself, you gonna have to change some stuff.

   - What you will need to modify
     1. You need to change the id to send messages in [handler](https://github.com/Dadangdut33/Misaka-10032/blob/main/handler/Handler.js) and [reportbug](https://github.com/Dadangdut33/Misaka-10032/blob/main/modules/general/commands/info_bot/reportbug.js)
     2. Also change the id used in here [Member count](https://github.com/Dadangdut33/Misaka-10032/blob/main/modules/general/events/member-count.js) and [online count](https://github.com/Dadangdut33/Misaka-10032/blob/main/modules/general/events/online-member.js) 
     3. You need to change the id used for channel-logging in [start](https://github.com/Dadangdut33/Misaka-10032/blob/main/modules/general/events/start.js), you can also change the options to what you want
     4. You need to add your own token to .env
     5. And last, You will also need to add your own API keys from bitly and rapidAPI if you want to use that command 

   - Optional
     1. You should probably change the [about](https://github.com/Dadangdut33/Misaka-10032/blob/main/modules/general/commands/info_bot/about.js) info commands
     2. You can also changed the [haiku detection](https://github.com/Dadangdut33/Misaka-10032/blob/main/modules/general/events/msgListener.js) settings, i turn up the sensitivity cause it's not really working in the language that i use (Indonesia)
